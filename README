Introduction:

WarGS is a port of the 1996 DOS game War of Genesis II by Softmax to modern
operating systems. In particular, it runs on GNU/Linux, but it should also
work on any system supported by the SDL library on the i386 architecture.

As part of the port, only modernised executables which will
run on contemporary systems are provided. The game data is not provided.
To play the game, you will need to have the original data
from the War of Genesis II CD.

The port is not fully complete.

I got inpiration for creating this project from Syndicate Wars Port
<http://swars.vexillium.org/>.
