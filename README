Introduction:

WarGS is a port of the 1996 DOS game War of Genesis II (ver. 1.2) 
by Softmax to modern operating systems. In particular, it runs on
GNU/Linux i386 and WIN32, but it should also work on any system
supported by the SDL library on the i386 architecture.

As part of the port, only modernised executables which will
run on contemporary systems are provided. The game data is not provided.
To play the game, you will need to have the original data
from the War of Genesis II CD and 1.2 patch file.

The port is not fully complete.

I got inpiration for creating this project from Syndicate Wars Port
<http://swars.vexillium.org/>.

6. Run wargs-setup -c CDROM -p PATCH, where
   - CDROM is the game CD path, like /media/cdrom
   - PATCH is the patch file released by Softmax, like pat12.exe

If you need more information about wargs-setup, run wargs-setup --help

WIN32
To install WarGS on WIN32, you need the followings.
- MinGW with MSYS
- Python (>= 2.4)
- ARJ unpacker
- ZIP unpacker
- CD audio ripping tool

Once you've made sure you have the above, proceed with the following steps.
1. Download and unpack the source tarball.
2. Go into the src directory in the newly created directory on MSYS
3. Edit Makefile.windows to match your system setup.
4. Run make -f Makefile.windows
5. Copy wargs.exe, wargs-ttl.exe, wargs-combatii.exe, wargs-chp.exe
   and wargs-pack.exe to the location of your desire, says WarGSLocation.
6. Copy lib\SDL-1.2.14\lib\*.dll, lib\SDL_mixer-1.2.11\lib\*.dll and
   lib\libconfig-1.4.7\lib\*.dll to WarGSLocation.
7. Add the WarGSLocation to PATH environment variable.
8. Copy tool\wargs-run to the WarGSLocation.
9. Copy GENESIS2\* in the game CD to the location of your desire,
   says WarGSDataLocation.
10. Unpack DOSINST.ARJ in the game CD to the WarGSDataLocation.
11. Unpack the patch file to the WarGSDataLocation.
12. Rip the game CD audio tracks to trackNN.ogg (track01, track02, ...).
13. Creat a WarGSDataLocation\music directory and copy the previously encoded
    ogg vorbis files there.
14. Make configuration file,
    %HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\Local Settings\Application Data\WarGS\wargs.conf


Configuration:

GNU/Linux: ~/.WarGS/wargs.conf
WIN32: %HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\Local Settings\Application Data\WarGS\wargs.conf

It is libconfig accessible file. And it has INI similar format.
The following options are supported.
- root
  Set the game data directory.
  NOTICE: This is required option.

  (e.g. "/home/foo/.WarGS")
  (e.g. "c:\\documents and settings\\foo\\Application Data\\WarGS")
- fast

  This has true/false boolean value.
  If this option is omitted, default is false.

  This has natural number.
  If this option is omitted, default is 1.
- center
  Set the window position center always.
  This has true/false boolean value.
  If this option is omitted, default is false.

Example on GNU/Linux
root = "/home/foo/.WarGS";
fast = false;
music = true;
sound = true;
ratio = 2;
center = true;
verbose = false;

Example on WIN32
root = "c:\\documents and settings\\foo\\application data\\WarGS";
fast = false;
music = true;
sound = true;
ratio = 2;
center = true;
verbose = false;
